# Chaos Construction: Gaps

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/27s3ylrt](/assets/images/puzzle1.png)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Some numbers are already given. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

Both cells that an arrow touches belong to the same region, and the cell directly in front of an arrow is not in that region. The number on the tail of an arrow indicates how many cells (in the indicated direction) in different regions must be travelled across until another cell belonging to the same region is reached.

Numbers separated by a white dot are part of the same region, and are consecutive.
