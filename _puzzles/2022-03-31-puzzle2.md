# Chaos Construction: Vision

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/24fnfwtu](/assets/images/puzzle2.png)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Some numbers are already given. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

A number placed at the tail of an arrow indicates how many cells directly in front of the arrow belong to the same region as the cell at the tail of the arrow, until either another region or the edge of the grid is reached.
