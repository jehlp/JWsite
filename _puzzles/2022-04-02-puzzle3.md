# Chaos Construction: X-Sums and Lines

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

### X-Sums:

A number outside the grid indicates the sum of the first N numbers from the direction of the clue, where N is the number closest to the clue. The first N numbers are also all in the same region, and the N+1th number is in a different region.

### Contiguous Lines:

A number N in a colored cell indicates that there must be a contiguous line of exactly N cells that contain the colored cell all within the same region. The line may be horizontal, vertical, or possibly both.
