# Chaos Construction: Killer Cages

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

An area outlined by dashes is called a killer cage. All numbers in a killer cage belong to the same region and sum to the number in the top left corner of the killer cage.
