# Chaos Construction: Region Sums

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/2ayc4ps4](/assets/images/puzzle5.png)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. One number is already given. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

Region borders divide the blue lines into segments with the same sum. Every line must visit at least two regions. In the bottom two rows, there is an instance of two lines crossing; these are different lines. A number in a colored cell indicates the total count of numbers on the segment of the blue line within that region.

A black circle indicates that it is possible to form a consecutive sequence using the four touching numbers.
