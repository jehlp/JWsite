# Chaos Construction: X-Sums / Sandwich

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Some numbers are already given. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

A clue outside the grid can mean one of two things, as written below. A question mark indicates a nonzero, positive valued number.

### X-Sums:

A number outside the grid indicates the sum of the first N numbers from the direction of the clue, where N is the number closest to the clue. The first N numbers are also all in the same region, and the N+1th number is in a different region.

### Sandwich:

A number outside the grid indicates the sum of the numbers between the 1 and 9 in that row or column. The numbers between the 1 and the 9 are all in the same region, and that region does not include the surrounding 1 and 9. If two clues share the same row or column, they cannot both be this type.
