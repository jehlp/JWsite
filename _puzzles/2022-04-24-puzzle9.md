# Chaos Construction: Border Sums

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. One number is already given. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

A clue outside the grid indicates the sum of the two numbers in the cells separated by the first region border seen when looking into the grid from the direction of the clue.
