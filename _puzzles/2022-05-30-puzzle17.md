# Chaos Shikaku

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row and column.

Divide the grid entirely into rectangles such that each rectangle contains exactly one colored cell, which contains the size of the rectangle. Numbers must not repeat in a rectangle.

If a white dot falls on the border between two rectangles, then the sums of the numbers within the two rectangles are consecutive. If a black dot falls on the border between two rectangles, then the sums of the numbers within the two rectangles are in a 1 to 2 ratio.

If a white dot does not fall on the border between two rectangles, then the two numbers it separates are consecutive. Likewise, if a black dot does not fall on the border between two rectangles, then the two numbers it separates are in a 1 to 2 ratio.

Not all possible dots are necessarily given.
