# Chaos Construction: Sightlines (1)

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/2a9o26gh](/assets/images/puzzle18.png)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

A number in a cell with arrows indicates the number of cells seen in the indicated directions combined (including itself), where region borders obstruct vision.
