## Rules:

Divide the grid into orthogonally connected regions, and enter into each cell the size of the region the cell belongs to. No two regions of the same size may share an edge. For each type of clue, exactly one occurrence must not be correctly satisfied. The clue types are as follows:

### Even Square:

A gray square must contain an even number.

### White Kropki:

A white dot separates two consecutive numbers.

### Black Kropki:

A black dot separates two numbers that are in a ratio of 1 to 2.

### Whisper:

Adjacent numbers along a green line must differ by at least 5.

### Renban:

Numbers along a red line form a consecutive sequence, but the sequence might not be in order along the line.

### Thermometer:

A thick grey line with a circle at one end is called a thermometer. Numbers along a thermometer must strictly increase as you travel away from the circled end.

### Arrow:

Numbers along an arrow must sum to the number in the attached circle.

### Skyscraper:

Treat each number N as a building of height N. A clue outside the grid indicates the number of buildings seen from from that direction, where taller buildings hide equal or shorter buildings.
