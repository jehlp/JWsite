# Chaos Construction: Aquarium (2)

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/26sbdkv7](/assets/images/puzzle22.png)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

Every cell in the grid is either 'air' or 'water'. Within each region, each row of cells is either all air or all water, and all air cells must be above all water cells. A number outside the grid indicates the total number of water cells in the indicated row or column.

If a cell with arrows is 'air', the number placed in that cell indicates the total number of water cells in the indicated directions combined. Likewise, if a cell with arrows is 'water', the number placed in that cell indicates the total number of air cells in the indicated directions combined.
