# Chaos Deconstruction: Position Sums

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 in the grid such that no number repeats in any row or column. Each number belongs to an orthogonally connected region that contains each number from 1 to 9 exactly once. The regions must be located by the solver, and there are 9 total regions that must be located.

A number placed on a cell with an arrow indicates the total number of empty cells in the direction of that arrow. A cell with an arrow must not be empty.

An inner outside clue indicates the sum of the first two numbers seen when looking into the grid from the location of the clue. We call those two numbers A and B. An outer outside clue indicates the sum of the numbers in the Ath and Bth cells when looking into the grid from the location of the clue. If an outer outside clue is present, it guarantees the Ath and Bth cells are nonempty.

If an outside clue is colored, then the summed cells belong to the same region. If an outside clue is not colored, then the summed cells belong to different regions. A question mark may be any positive integer.
