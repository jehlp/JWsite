# Chaos Deconstruction: Cave

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 in the grid such that no number repeats in any row or column. Some numbers are already given. Each number belongs to an orthogonally connected region that contains each number from 1 to 9 exactly once. The regions must be located by the solver, and there are 9 total regions that must be located.

A number in a colored cell indicates the total amount of numbers seen in all four orthogonal directions, including itself, where region borders obstruct vision. Colored cells must not be empty.

All numbers are orthogonally connected, and all orthogonally connected groups of empty cells touch the perimeter of the grid.
