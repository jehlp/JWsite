# Canal View Sudoku

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/2bknlkd8](/assets/images/puzzle27.png)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and box. Some numbers are already given.

Shade some cells such that all shaded cells are orthogonally connected and no 2x2 area is entirely shaded. A number in a colored cell indicates the total number of shaded cells connected in a straight line horizontally or vertically to the clue. A colored cell is never shaded.

Numbers cannot repeat in any orthogonally connected group of unshaded cells. A cell with a number in its top left corner is not shaded, and indicates that cell is part of an orthogonally connected group of unshaded cells that sum to the given total.
