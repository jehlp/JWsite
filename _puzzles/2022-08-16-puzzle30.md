# Chaos Construction: Sightlines (2)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 10 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

A number in a cell with arrows indicates the number of cells seen in the indicated directions combined (including itself), where region borders obstruct vision.
