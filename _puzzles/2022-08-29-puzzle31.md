# Japanese Cave

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row and column. All numbers are orthogonally connected and all orthogonally connected groups of empty cells touch the perimeter. A number in a colored cell indicates the total number of cells seen in all four orthogonal directions, including itself, where empty cells obstruct vision. A colored cell may not be empty.

Clues outside the grid indicate the sums of connected groups of numbers in the respective row or column, in order, where empty cells serve as delimiters between groups. A question mark can be any number from 0 to 9, but no clue may have a leading zero. A pound sign can be any number. An asterisk indicates obscured information; in place of an asterisk may be zero, one, or multiple groups of numbers.
