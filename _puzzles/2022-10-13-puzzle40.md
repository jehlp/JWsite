# Crypto Japanese Cave (2)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 0 to 9 exactly once in every row and column.

Shade some cells such that all unshaded cells are orthogonally connected, and all orthogonally connected groups of shaded cells touch the edge of the grid.

Clues outside the grid indicate the sums of connected groups of either shaded or unshaded numbers in the respective row or column, in order, where numbers in cells with the opposite shading serve as delimiters between groups. All the columns are for one of either shaded or unshaded, and all of the rows are for whichever type of shading the columns is not.

The letters A to H replace numbers from 0 to 9, and no two letters may replace the same number. A question mark can be any number from 0 to 9, and for all double digit clues, none may have a leading zero.
