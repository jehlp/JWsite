# Crypto Japanese Cave (Fillomino)

## Rules:

Shade some cells such that all unshaded cells are orthogonally connected, and all orthogonally connected groups of shaded cells touch the edge of the grid.

Divide the grid into orthogonally connected regions such that no two regions of the same size share an edge, and enter into each cell the number that is the size of the region containing it. No region contains both a shaded cell and an unshaded cell. A number in a cell with one or more arrows indicates the total number of cells with opposite shading to itself in the indicated directions combined.

Clues outside the grid to the top and left indicate the sums of connected groups of either shaded or unshaded numbers in the respective row or column, in order, where numbers in cells with the opposite shading serve as delimiters between groups. All the columns are for one of either shaded or unshaded, and all of the rows are for whichever type of shading the columns is not.

The letters A to G replace numbers from 0 to 9, and no two letters may replace the same number. A question mark can be any number from 0 to 9, and for all clues, none may have a leading zero.
