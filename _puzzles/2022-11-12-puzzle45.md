# Crypto Japanese Slitherlink

## Rules:

Draw a loop that travels along the edges of cells that does not touch or cross itself. Then, place the numbers from 1 to 9 in all the cells enclosed by the loop such that no number repeats in a row or column. Cells outside the loop cannot contain numbers. Every 1, 2, and 3 placed in the grid indicates the total number of edges surrounding itself that are used by the loop.

Clues outside the grid indicate the sums of connected groups of numbers in the respective row or column, in order, where empty cells serve as delimiters between groups.

The letters A to J replace the numbers from 0 to 9, and no two letters may replace the same number. A question mark can be any number from 0 to 9, and for all clues, none may have a leading zero.
