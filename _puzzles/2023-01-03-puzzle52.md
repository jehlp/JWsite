# Twilight Nurikabe

## Rules:

Shade some cells in the grid such that all shaded cells are connected and no 2x2 area is entirely shaded.

We call orthogonally connected groups of unshaded cells islands. If a number is on an island cell, it indicates the size of the island. Every island must have exactly one number on it.

If a number is on a shaded cell, it indicates the total number of shaded cells visible in all four directions from that cell (including itself), where island cells obstruct vision.
