# Halligen Knapp Daneben

## Rules:

Divide the grid into island cells and water cells. The water is orthogonally connected, and no 2x2 area is entirely water. Every island contains exactly one number that is its size.

Ships are to be placed in some water cells. If a number is in a water cell, it is a lighthouse, which indicates the total number of ships that share a row or column with that lighthouse. Ships may not touch each other, or lighthouses, even diagonally. Lighthouses may only touch other lighthouses diagonally.

Every clue is exactly one too large or one too small.
