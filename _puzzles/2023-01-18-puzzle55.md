# Crypto Japanese Cave-Bahn

## Rules:

Shade some cells in the grid such that all unshaded cells are orthogonally connected, and all orthogonally connected groups of shaded cells touch the perimeter of the grid. Then, enter numbers from 1 to 9 in every shaded cell such that no number repeats in a row or column. Numbers must not be placed in unshaded cells.

Clues outside the grid indicate the sums of connected groups of numbers in the respective row or column, in order, where unshaded cells serve as delimiters between groups.

The letters A to J replace the numbers from 0 to 9, and no two letters may replace the same number. A question mark can be any number from 0 to 9, and for all clues, none may have a leading zero. 

### U-Bahn:

Draw a totally connected loop network through the centers of all unshaded cells, which may branch or turn, but may not have any dead ends. A clue outside the grid indicates how many times the corresponding line shape (i.e. a cross, branch, straight line, or turn) appears in the corresponding row or column, irrespective of the line shape's rotation.
