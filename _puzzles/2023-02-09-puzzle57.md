# Chaos Construction: Roller Coaster

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

Draw a non-intersecting loop that travels orthogonally between the centers of some cells in the grid. Clues to the left of rows indicate the sum of numbers on horizontal segments of the loop in that row, in the correct order. Clues above columns indicate the sum of numbers on vertical segments of the loop in that column, in the correct order. A question mark may replace any number from 0-9, but no clue may have a leading zero.

On a single round trip of the loop, every region must be entered and exited exactly once.
