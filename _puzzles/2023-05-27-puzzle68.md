# Extraterrestrial Tripleblock with X-Sums

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row and column of the grid.

Clues above and to the left of the grid are tripleblock clues: the first value gives the sum of the numbers between the first and second empty cell in the row or column. The second value gives the sum of the numbers between the second and last empty cell in the row or column. These values may be zero if the empty cells are adjacent.

Clues to the right and bottom of the grid are X-sum clues: the value indicates the sum of the numbers in the first X cells from that direction, where X is the first seen number in that direction.

The clues are given by an extraterrestrial, who uses an unknown number base N. The letters A-I replace numbers from 0 to N-1, and no two letters may replace the same number. No multi-digit clue may have a leading zero.
