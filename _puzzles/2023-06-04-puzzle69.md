## Rules:

Divide the grid into island cells and water cells. The water is orthogonally connected, and no 2x2 area is entirely water. Every island contains exactly one colored cell.

Ships are to be placed in some water cells. A colored water cell is called a lighthouse, and ships may not touch lighthouses or other ships, even diagonally. Lighthouses may only touch other lighthouses diagonally.

Place numbers from 1 to 9 on every island cell, ship, and lighthouse such that no number repeats in a row or column, or on an island. No water cell may contain a number. Clues outside the grid indicate the sums of connected groups of numbers in the respective row or column, in order, where empty cells serve as delimiters between groups.

A number on a colored cell on an island indicates the size of the island containing that cell. A number on a lighthouse indicates the total number of ships that share a row or column with that lighthouse.

Eleven of the twelve letters in outside clues replace unique numbers from 0 to 10. The letter that replaces 10 never appears in a two digit clue. The last letter replaces a different number from 0 to 9 in each occurrence. A question mark can be any number from 0 to 9, and for all clues, none may have a leading zero.
