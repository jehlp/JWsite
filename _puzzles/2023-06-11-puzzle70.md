# Chaos Deconstruction: Sightlines

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/29tdyb3z](/assets/images/puzzle70.png)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 in the grid such that no number repeats in any row or column. Some numbers are already given. Each number belongs to an orthogonally connected region that contains each number from 1 to 9 exactly once. The regions must be located by the solver, and there are 9 total regions that must be located.

If a cell with an arrow or arrows is nonempty, the number placed in that cell indicates the number of cells seen in the indicated directions combined (including itself). Region borders and empty cells obstruct vision. If a cell with an arrow or arrows is empty, there must be at least one empty cell in the direction of each arrow in that cell.
