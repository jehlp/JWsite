# U-Bahn with Empty Clues (1)

## Rules:

Draw a totally connected loop network through the centers of some cells, which may branch or turn, but may not have any dead ends.

A clue outside the grid indicates how many times the corresponding line shape (i.e. a cross, branch, straight line, turn, or empty cell) appears in the corresponding row or column, irrespective of the line shape's rotation.
