# Doppelcrypto Japanese Cave

## Rules:

Shade some cells in the grid such that all unshaded cells are orthogonally connected, no 2x2 area is entirely unshaded, and all orthogonally connected groups of shaded cells touch the perimeter of the grid. Then, enter numbers from 1 to 9 in every unshaded cell such that no number repeats in a row or column. Numbers must not be placed in shaded cells.

Clues outside the grid indicate the sums of connected groups of numbers in the respective row or column, in order, where shaded cells serve as delimiters between groups.

All colored cells contain numbers, and the number placed indicates the amount of unshaded cells seen in all orthogonal directions, where empty cells obstruct vision. All possible colored cells are given.

There are two distinct mappings of the numbers 0 to 9 to the letters A to J. Each given letter may refer to either mapping. Tens digits are guaranteed to be nonzero.
