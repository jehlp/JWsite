# Stations / Cave

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/24vxxksy](/assets/images/puzzle79.png)

## Rules:

### Stations:

Draw a closed loop through the center of some cells that passes through the numbers 1 to 9 in order. Each number is passed through exactly once and all other numbers are unvisited. The loop may not turn on numbers it passes through, and the loop crosses itself exactly at the given intersections.

### Cave:

Some cells are to be shaded such that all unshaded cells are connected, and all connected groups of shaded cells touch the perimeter of the grid. A number not visited by the loop is unshaded and indicates the number of unshaded cells seen in all four directions from the cell containing the number, including itself. All numbers visited by the loop as well as intersections are shaded.

Along the loop, there may never be three shaded or three unshaded cells visited sequentially.
