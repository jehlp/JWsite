## Rules:

Place the complete set of dominos from 1-1 to 9-9 in the grid once each. Numbers must not repeat in a row or column, unless the repeated digits are contained in the same domino.

Clues outside the grid indicate the sums of connected groups of numbers in the respective row or column, in order, where empty cells serve as delimiters between groups.
