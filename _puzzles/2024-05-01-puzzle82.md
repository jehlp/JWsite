# Chaos Construction: Exclusions

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 8 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

A cell with an arrow (or arrows) indicates how many cells in the indicated directions combined that do not belong to the same region as that cell.
