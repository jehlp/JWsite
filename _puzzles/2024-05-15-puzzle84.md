# Chaos Construction: Disconnected (1)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 6 exactly once in every row, column, and region. The regions are themselves connected, orthogonally, diagonally, or possibly both, and must be located by the solver.

A number in the top left corner of a cell indicates the sum of the numbers in the orthogonally connected section of the region that cell belongs to. A colored cell indicates the size of the orthogonally connected section of the region that cell belongs to. All possible colored cells are given.
