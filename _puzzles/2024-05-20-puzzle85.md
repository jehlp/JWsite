# Chaos Construction: Disconnected (2)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. One number is already given. The regions are themselves connected, orthogonally, diagonally, or possibly both, and must be located by the solver.

A number in the top left corner of a cell indicates the sum of the numbers in the orthogonally connected section of the region that cell belongs to. A question mark can be any number from 0 to 9, and for all double digit clues, none may have a leading zero. A colored cell indicates the size of the orthogonally connected section of the region that cell belongs to. All possible colored cells are given.
