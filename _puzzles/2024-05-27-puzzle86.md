# Black or White Coral

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/26j5jqzn](/assets/images/puzzle86.png)

## Rules:

A coral is to be drawn in the grid: the coral is orthogonally connected, contains no 2x2 area, and does not 'lock in' any cells; that is, all orthogonally connected groups of non-coral cells are orthogonally connected to the boundary.

Clues outside the grid give the lengths of either non-coral or coral segments in the row or column. Where clues are given, they are complete, but not necessarily in the correct order. No row or column contains clues for both non-coral and coral segments at once (this does not necessarily mean the possible non-coral and coral clues for any row or column must be different).
