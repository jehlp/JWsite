## Rules:

Shade some cells such that all unshaded cells are orthogonally connected, and there may not exist a run of four or more consecutive shaded or unshaded cells horizontally or vertically anywhere in the grid.

All cells containing a number must not be shaded, and the number in the cell indicates the total count of shaded cells in orthogonally connected groups sharing an edge with that number.

A '?' indicates a single digit number. A '??' indicates a double digit number.
