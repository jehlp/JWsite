# Japanese Ranking

## Rules:

Place numbers from 1 to 9 in some cells such that no number repeats in a row or column. Clues outside the grid correspond to the sums of groups of connected cells in the row or column shared with the clues; empty cells serve as the delimiter between groups.

A clue indicates the 'ranking' of a sum of a group in its row or column, where 1 is the smallest sum, 2 is the second smallest sum, and so on. If multiple clues within a row or column have the same ranking, that means their corresponding sums are equal.
