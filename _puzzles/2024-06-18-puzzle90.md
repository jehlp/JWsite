# Checkered Slitherlink

## Rules:

Draw a loop that travels along the edges of some cells that does not touch or cross itself. Each marked 4x4 area contains the same clue type, and orthogonally adjacent 4x4 areas contain different clue types. The possible clue types are as follows:

### Edge hint: 
The clue indicates the total number of edges surrounding the clue cell that are used by the loop.

### Touch hint: 
The clue indicates the total number of times the loop visits the clue cell. A visit is defined as a contiguous section of the loop traveling on the boundary of the cell, including the possibility of just a single corner point; two such sections are considered separate visits if the loop leaves the boundary of the cell between them.

### Vertex hint: 
The clue indicates the total number of vertices surrounding the clue cell that are used by the loop.

### Turn hint: 
The clue indicates the total number of vertices surrounding the clue cell at which the loop makes a turn.
