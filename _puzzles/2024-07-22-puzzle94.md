# Sorted Subway

## Rules:

Draw a totally connected loop network through the centers of some cells, which may branch or turn, but may not have any dead ends.

Clues outside the grid indicate how many turns, straight lines, branches, or crosses occur in the row or column, irrespective of the line shape's rotation. If a row or column is clued, all nonzero clues are listed and are provided in ascending order. A question mark can be any positive integer.
