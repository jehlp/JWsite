# Japanese Slitherlink

## Rules:

Draw a loop that travels along the edges of some cells that does not touch or cross itself. Then, place numbers from 0 to 9 in all the cells enclosed by the loop such that no number from 4 to 9 repeats in any row or column. The numbers from 0 to 3 may occur any amount of times in a row or column. Cells outside the loop cannot contain numbers. A cell with a 0, 1, 2, or 3 placed in it indicates the total number of edges surrounding itself that are used by the loop.

Clues outside the grid indicate the sums of connected groups of numbers inside the loop in the respective row or column, in order, where cells outside the loop serve as delimiters between groups. A question mark can be any number from 0 to 9, and for all clues, none may have a leading zero.
