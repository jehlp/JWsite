# Pentominous U-Bahn (Warm-up #1)

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/28a4o9g5](/assets/images/puzzle98.png)

## Rules:

Tessellate the entire grid into pentominos (orthogonally connected regions of exactly five cells) such that no two pentominos of the same shape share an edge. Rotations and reflections of a shape are counted as the same shape.

Draw a totally connected loop network through the centers of some cells, which may branch or turn, but may not have any dead ends. A clue outside the grid indicates how many times the corresponding line shape (i.e. a cross, branch, straight line, or turn) appears in the corresponding row or column, irrespective of the line shape's rotation.

Within a pentomino, all non-empty cells must be the same line shape.
