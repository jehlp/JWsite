# Chaos Construction: Color Mixing

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/243wjns7](/assets/images/puzzle14.png)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

There are three properties: red, yellow, and blue. A colored cell obeys the properties, and only the properties, of the primary colors that compose it.

### Red: 
The number indicates the total count of cells in the same region as itself in the surrounding 3x3 area.

### Yellow: 
The number indicates the total count of cells not in the same region as itself in the surrounding 3x3 area.

### Blue: 
The number indicates the number of distinct regions in the surrounding 3x3 area. 

*Orange = Red + Yellow*\
*Green = Yellow + Blue*\
*Purple = Red + Blue*\
*Grey = Red + Yellow + Blue*
