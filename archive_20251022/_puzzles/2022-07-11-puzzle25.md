# Chaos Construction: Internal X-Sums

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/2bvyaha4](/assets/images/puzzle25.png)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 exactly once in every row, column, and region. Some numbers are already given. Each region is orthogonally connected and must be located by the solver.

A digit X in a cell containing a number N in its top left corner indicates that cell sees X digits in its region and that those digits sum to N, where region borders obstruct vision. A question mark can be any positive integer.
