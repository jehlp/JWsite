# Extraterrestrial Japanese Sums

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/2c7at8sm](/assets/images/puzzle58.png)

## Rules:

Place the numbers from 1 to 9 in some cells such that no number repeats in a row or column. Clues outside the grid indicate the sums of connected groups of numbers in the respective row or column, in order, where empty cells serve as delimiters between groups.

The clues are given by an extraterrestrial, who uses an unknown number base N. The given letters replace numbers from 0 to N-1, and no two letters may replace the same number. For all clues, none may have a leading zero.
