# U-Bahn (2)

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/27y7o3uc](/assets/images/puzzle65.png)

## Rules:

Draw a totally connected loop network through the centers of some cells, which may branch or turn, but may not have any dead ends.

A clue outside the grid indicates how many times the corresponding line shape (i.e. a cross, branch, straight line, or turn) appears in the corresponding row or column, irrespective of the line shape's rotation.
