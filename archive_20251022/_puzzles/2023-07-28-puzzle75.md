# U-Bahn with Empty Clues (4) (Crypto)

![Solve #right #link=https://tinyurl.com/22ctwute](/assets/images/puzzle75.png)

## Rules:

Draw a totally connected loop network through the centers of some cells, which may branch or turn, but may not have any dead ends.

A clue outside the grid indicates how many times the corresponding line shape (i.e. a cross, branch, straight line, turn, or empty cell) appears in the corresponding row or column, irrespective of the line shape's rotation.

The letters A through E replace unique numbers. A question mark can be any number as long as it is not the same as any number replaced by a letter.
